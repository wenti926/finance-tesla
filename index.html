            SolarCity in Buffalo, New York.

        Stock is up an incredible 659% in 2020, making it one of most valuable companies in the world with a $630
        billion
        valuation. Tesla stock is up more than 4000% since its debut 10 years age. The company raised around $226
        million in its IPO, with shares surging that day by around 41% to close at $23.89, meaning Tesla’s stock has
        risen by 4,125% since the close of its first days as a public company.

          (research and development, administrative, etc) before getting the net income (before taxes)

          Tesla is planning to grow thier manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible. Over a multi-year horizon, they
          expect to achieve
          50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. In some years we may grow faster, which they expect to be the
          case in 2021.
          The rate of growth will depend on thier equipment capacity, operational efficiency and capacity and stability
          of
          the supply chain.

        <div id="myDiv1" class="container content"></div>
        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
          Total revenue grew 46% YoY in Q4. This was primarily achieved through substantial growth in vehicle deliveries
          as well as growth in other
          parts of the business. At the same time, vehicle average selling price (ASP) declined by 11% YoY as Teslas's
          product mix continued to shift from
          Model S and Model X to the more affordable Model 3 and Model Y.
        </div>
        <div id="myDiv2" class="container content"></div>
        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
          Quarter-end cash and cash equivalents increased to $19.4B in Q4, driven mainly by Tesla's recent capital raise
          of
          $5.0B (average price of this offering was ~$632/share) and free cash flow of $1.9B, partially offset by early
          debt repayments (early
          conversion of convertible notes).

        <div id="myDiv3" class="container content"></div>
        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
          GAAP gross profit of $4.1B remained essentially flat in 2019 compared to 2018. Volume growth and successful
          cost reduction
          efforts were offset by normalization of ASP, mix shift towards Model 3 and a higher lease mix.<br>
          Sequentially, GAAP gross margin remained relatively flat in Q4 compared to Q3, while we ramped Model 3
          production at
          Gigafactory Shanghai. <br>While we saw an increase in operating expenses in Q4 (driven mostly by $72M of
          non-cash
          SBC expense
          related to one more 2018 CEO award operational milestone becoming probable), higher gross profit resulted in a
          72bp sequential
          improvement of GAAP operating margin to 4.9% in Q4.

          On one hand we can notice that the operating margin and the adjusted ebitda have the same behavior. Both of
          them have started growing since 2017 and never stopped.
          On the other hand, the automative and total GAAP are moving together and tend to be almost constant
